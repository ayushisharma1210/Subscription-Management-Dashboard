# Clarity - Subscription Management Dashboard 

A UI/UX case study for a clean, intuitive, and empowering dashboard that helps users manage their monthly subscriptions and gain financial clarity.


 â–º The Problem

In today's digital world, the average person subscribes to numerous servicesâ€”streaming, music, work tools, fitness, and more. This "subscription creep" leads to a lack of financial clarity, unexpected charges, and difficulty in managing recurring payments.

> Users often have no idea how much they're spending, get surprised by charges, and continue paying for services they no longer use simply because they forgot to cancel.

â–º The Solution

Clarity is a single-page dashboard designed to replace financial anxiety with a sense of control. It provides a centralized hub where users can see, manage, and understand all their subscriptions at a glance. The design focuses on presenting data in a calm, digestible, and empowering way, turning a confusing list of expenses into actionable insights.


 Key Features

-   **At-a-Glance Dashboard:** Key metrics like "Total Monthly Spend," "Upcoming Payments," and "Highest Subscription" are immediately visible.
-   **Detailed Subscription List:** A clean, sortable list of all active subscriptions with clear billing dates and costs.
-   **Interactive Modals:** Users can click on key metrics (like "Upcoming Payments") to see a detailed, focused breakdown in a pop-up window without leaving the dashboard.
-   **Urgent Payment Alerts:** A dedicated card highlights payments that are due soon, helping users avoid surprises.
-   **Simple "Add Subscription" Flow:** A frictionless, intuitive modal for adding new services.
-   **Responsive Design:** The interface is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.


ðŸ‘¤ My Role & Design Process

As the sole UI/UX designer on this conceptual project, I was responsible for the end-to-end design process.

1.  **Empathize & Define:** The process began by identifying the core user problem and creating a persona ("Aarav," a young professional in Pune) to understand the user's goals and frustrations.
2.  **Ideation & Wireframing:** I sketched low-fidelity layouts to establish the information architecture and visual hierarchy for a data-heavy dashboard.
3.  **UI Design & Prototyping:** I developed the high-fidelity, polished interface in Figma, focusing on a clean, calming aesthetic. I created interactive prototypes to simulate the user flow, especially for the modal pop-ups.
4.  **Iteration:** Based on the initial design, I focused on enriching the UI with subtle gradients, softer shadows, and a clear typographic scale to make the design more engaging and less "boring" while maintaining clarity.
